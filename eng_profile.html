            <h2>self-promotion</h2>
            In university, I am studying both software and hardware knowledge, such as information science and control engineering. One of my strengths is my strong spirit of challenge, regardless of whether I am weak or strong in a particular subject. I am a member of a robotics team in another department, where I am learning a wide range of knowledge outside my major. Additionally, I have started studying English and spent four weeks studying abroad in the Philippines to improve my skills. In the winter, I plan to study abroad in Spain, where I will conduct research in the field of AI.

            During my student days, I focused on robotics competitions. Through this experience, I learned the importance of both the depth and breadth of knowledge. At first, I struggled to effectively combine systems because my knowledge of robotics was limited. However, by exchanging knowledge with people outside my field and gaining a deeper understanding of their perspectives, I was able to develop systems with higher accuracy than before.

                Research Content</h2>
            
The research focuses on estimation of speech recognition results. While recent advancements in speech recognition technology have been remarkable, there is no guarantee of 100% accuracy due to the inherent nature of the recognition mechanism. In everyday speech recognition, errors are observed compared to readings, and this poses challenges for developers using existing recognition systems for app development. Hence, there is a need for mechanisms to evaluate the reliability of recognition results. If the recognition results are deemed unreliable, consideration should be given to how they are used in the app. Despite efforts to improve speech recognition accuracy, the packaging of speech recognition systems as black boxes in recent years has made it difficult to easily improve them. To address this issue, the research hypothesizes that input speech causing recognition errors is more ambiguous and unstable in time compared to clear pronunciations, and proposes to estimate the reliability of recognition results by evaluating the stability of speech. By subjecting input speech to distortion processing to the extent that it does not affect stability, the change in speech recognition results can be observed to estimate reliability.

            <h2>Extracurricular Activities</h2>
            I participate in the RoboCup Japan Open and contribute to various aspects, particularly focusing on speech recognition. In this competition, where robots must understand instructions and perform tasks, speech recognition plays a crucial role. While we previously utilized Julius for speech recognition, adopting Whisper has significantly improved recognition accuracy and enabled recognition of previously unforeseen content. Currently, we are integrating ChatGPT to enhance understanding of task content, such as improving part-of-speech decomposition accuracy.

            In addition to my robotics involvement, I also juggle four part-time jobs: tutoring at a cram school, working at a supermarket, a convenience store, and serving as a teaching assistant on campus.

            <h2>hobby</h2>
            My hobby is badminton. I have been a member of the badminton clubs in both junior high and high school, and I continue to pursue it in university by joining the badminton circles at both Osaka University and Kansai University, playing at least once a week. During my study abroad in Cebu Island, I played badminton at a local sports center and even had the opportunity to compete with and bond with locals who happened to be there.
